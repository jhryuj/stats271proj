Class project for stats271. This is a work in progress. 

Estimation for LQG observer. 

- estimation/lqg_estim: contains the main script. 
- estimation/EM_estimation: contains the codes for the EM algorithm
- estimation/observer: sets up the observer with perceptual/control parameters
- estimation/lqg:  the linear quadratic gaussian model for perception/control
- dynamics/hand1D: contains the dynamics of the target/cursor for the task.
